## User Management Table
This project is a React-based frontend application that displays a user management table. The table includes features like filtering users by various criteria (name, username, email, phone) and dynamically fetching user data using Redux.

## Project Overview

The User Management Table allows users to:

- Display a list of users in a table format.
- Filter users by name, username, email, and phone.
- Fetch user data from an API.
- Display loading and error states based on the API request status.
  Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- CSS: Styling the application with responsive design considerations.

## Features

- Dynamic Data Fetching: Fetch user data from an API when the component mounts.
- Filtering: Users can filter the table by typing into the input fields for name, username, email, and phone.
- Loading and Error States: Visual feedback is provided during data loading and when an error occurs.

## Additional Notes

- The project uses Flexbox for layout management.
- The input filters are responsive and stretch across the screen for better usability.
- Future Improvements
- Add pagination to handle a larger dataset.
- Implement sorting by columns.
- Enhance the styling and responsiveness for better mobile support.
